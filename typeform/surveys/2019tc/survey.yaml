    Thanks for taking this survey! Together, maybe we'll be able to figure out this Technical Communication thing once and for all!

    Also, we know this survey seems long, but it's mostly the same questions repeated for different frameworks and libraries. Most people only take around *10 minutes* to fill it in.
